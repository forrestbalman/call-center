		Call center is a no-experience-needed vocal piece that puts all participants inside of a remote
		tech support hotline service station.
	</h2>
	<p class="fs-5">
		Tech support hotlines... Sometimes they come in clutch when you need them most. Other times, it
		feels like a relentless cycle of abuse that makes you wonder: did I do something in a past life
		to deserve this? In this scenario, you're the tech support expert, and your handy-dandy
		AI-assisted electronics manual will feed you the exact lines to ensure that the customer gets
		their problem sorted out, and they stay calm throughout the whole process. Unfortunately, the AI
		is still being trained, so the steps to fixing your customer's issue may not always be the most
		direct nor intuitive. Remember, it's not your fault! You're just the messenger.
