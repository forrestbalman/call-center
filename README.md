Call center is a no-experience-needed vocal piece that puts all participants inside of a remote
tech support hotline service station.

Tech support hotlines ðŸ“ž... Sometimes they come in clutch when you need them most. Other times,
it feels like a relentless cycle of abuse that makes you wonder: did I do something in a past
life to deserve this? In this scenario, you're the tech support expert, and your handy-dandy
"AI-assisted" electronics manual will feed you the exact lines to ensure that the customer gets
their problem sorted out, and they stay calm throughout the whole process. Unfortunately, the AI
is still being trained, so the steps to fixing your customer's issue may not always be the most
direct nor intuitive. Remember, it's not your fault! You're just the messenger.

Have the person responsible for running sound click the listen button at the bottom-right of the home page while the rest of the participants connect via the play button. After clicking play, wait for a notification that confirms a listener is connected to the site and type your name in. Once you get the okay from the person running sound, click submit, and follow the call prompts.

Green text boxes are for you to read aloud, while red text boxes are customer responses and are not meant to be read aloud.
